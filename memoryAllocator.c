/*
 * Explicit Free List Memory Allocator
 *
 * This custom memory allocator creates and destroys blocks of memory for use by an outside
 * program. This is achieved using a block system that holds the size of the memory within the
 * block and whether or not it is allocated. This infomration is then used by the allocator
 * to find areas into which new data can be held.
 *
 * This allocator utilizes an Exlpicit Free List, meaning, it has a pointer to the most recently
 * available free block of memory. That block will also hold a pointer to the next (temporaly, not
 * spatially) free block and so on. This allows us to quickly jump between blocks to find one large
 * enough for the new data. This is called a "first-fit" algorithm.
 *
 * When memory is no longer needed, the outside program can free the space and this allocator will
 * mark the blocks as unallocated and coalesce them into unallocated neighbors to ensure the greatest
 * utilization of space. This applies for the Free List members as well. When the blocks are coalesced,
 * the pointers of the Free List are updated to keep a current list of availablity.
 *
 * When the allocator needs more memory, it requests a number of pages from the system and
 * initializes them as a new unit of the heap it is allocating. This ratio is carefully balanced as
 * too large will cause too much unused memory, but too small will cause constant calls to retrieve new
 * system pages. When a page (on our heap) is no longer in use the allocator will release it back to
 * the system.
